## Example

Here is a very basic example of how to use the `releases/create` composite action
in a project (placeholders are used in place of real inputs):

```yaml
run:
  example-job:
    # ... 
    steps:
      # ... 
      - name: Create a release
        id: create-a-release # only necessary if using this action's output(s)
        uses: bitwizeshift/actions-github/releases/create@v1
        with:
          # Required inputs
          tag-name: TAG_NAME

          # Optional inputs
          body: BODY
          draft: DRAFT
          generate-release-notes: GENERATE_RELEASE_NOTES
          name: NAME
          owner: OWNER
          prerelease: PRERELEASE
          repo: REPO
          retries: RETRIES
          retry-exempt-status-codes: RETRY_EXEMPT_STATUS_CODES
          target-commitish: TARGET_COMMITISH
      # ... 
      - name: Uses "Create a release" Outputs
        uses: example-actions/use-create-a-release@v3 # illustrative
        with:
          use-release-id: ${{ steps.create-a-release.outputs.release-id }}
          use-release-url: ${{ steps.create-a-release.outputs.release-url }}
          use-release-api-url: ${{ steps.create-a-release.outputs.release-api-url }}
