# Gets an issue

<!-- These docs are generated by a tool -->

A composite action for getting a github issue by its issue number.
This requires `issues: write` permissions in order to work correctly.

## Example

Here is a very basic example of how to use the `issues/get` composite action
in a project (placeholders are used in place of real inputs):

```yaml
run:
  example-job:
    # ... 
    steps:
      # ... 
      - name: Gets an issue
        id: issues-get # only necessary if using this action's output(s)
        uses: bitwizeshift/actions-github/issues/get@v1
        with:
          # Optional inputs
          github-token: GITHUB_TOKEN
          issue-number: ISSUE_NUMBER
          owner: OWNER
          repo: REPO
          retries: RETRIES
          retry-exempt-status-codes: RETRY_EXEMPT_STATUS_CODES
      # ... 
      - name: Uses "Gets an issue" Outputs
        uses: example-actions/use-issues-get@v3 # illustrative
        with:
          use-assignees: ${{ steps.issues-get.outputs.assignees }}
          use-assignees-count: ${{ steps.issues-get.outputs.assignees-count }}
          use-body: ${{ steps.issues-get.outputs.body }}
          use-issue-api-url: ${{ steps.issues-get.outputs.issue-api-url }}
          use-issue-number: ${{ steps.issues-get.outputs.issue-number }}
          use-issue-url: ${{ steps.issues-get.outputs.issue-url }}
          use-labels: ${{ steps.issues-get.outputs.labels }}
          use-labels-count: ${{ steps.issues-get.outputs.labels-count }}
          use-locked: ${{ steps.issues-get.outputs.locked }}
          use-state: ${{ steps.issues-get.outputs.state }}
          use-state-reason: ${{ steps.issues-get.outputs.state-reason }}
          use-title: ${{ steps.issues-get.outputs.title }}
```
