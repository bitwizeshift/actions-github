## Example

Here is a very basic example of how to use the `releases/upload-asset` composite action
in a project (placeholders are used in place of real inputs):

```yaml
run:
  example-job:
    # ... 
    steps:
      # ... 
      - name: Upload a release asset
        id: upload-a-release-asset # only necessary if using this action's output(s)
        uses: bitwizeshift/actions-github/releases/upload-asset@v1
        with:
          # Required inputs
          name: NAME
          path: PATH
          release-id: RELEASE_ID

          # Optional inputs
          owner: OWNER
          repo: REPO
          retries: RETRIES
          retry-exempt-status-codes: RETRY_EXEMPT_STATUS_CODES
      # ... 
      - name: Uses "Upload a release asset" Outputs
        uses: example-actions/use-upload-a-release-asset@v3 # illustrative
        with:
          use-asset-id: ${{ steps.upload-a-release-asset.outputs.asset-id }}
          use-asset-url: ${{ steps.upload-a-release-asset.outputs.asset-url }}
          use-asset-api-url: ${{ steps.upload-a-release-asset.outputs.asset-api-url }}
```
