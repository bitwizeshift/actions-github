# Get commit

## Example

Here is a very basic example of how to use the `git/get-commit` composite action
in a project (placeholders are used in place of real inputs):

```yaml
run:
  example-job:
    # ... 
    steps:
      # ... 
      - name: Get commit
        id: git-get-commit # only necessary if using this action's output(s)
        uses: bitwizeshift/actions-github/git/get-commit@v1
        with:
          # Optional inputs
          commit-sha: COMMIT_SHA
          github-token: GITHUB_TOKEN
          owner: OWNER
          repo: REPO
          retries: RETRIES
          retry-exempt-status-codes: RETRY_EXEMPT_STATUS_CODES
      # ... 
      - name: Uses "Get commit" Outputs
        uses: example-actions/use-git-get-commit@v3 # illustrative
        with:
          use-api-url: ${{ steps.git-get-commit.outputs.api-url }}
          use-author-email: ${{ steps.git-get-commit.outputs.author-email }}
          use-author-name: ${{ steps.git-get-commit.outputs.author-name }}
          use-committer-email: ${{ steps.git-get-commit.outputs.committer-email }}
          use-committer-name: ${{ steps.git-get-commit.outputs.committer-name }}
          use-message: ${{ steps.git-get-commit.outputs.message }}
          use-parents: ${{ steps.git-get-commit.outputs.parents }}
          use-sha: ${{ steps.git-get-commit.outputs.sha }}
          use-url: ${{ steps.git-get-commit.outputs.url }}
          use-verification-reason: ${{ steps.git-get-commit.outputs.verification-reason }}
          use-verified: ${{ steps.git-get-commit.outputs.verified }}
```
