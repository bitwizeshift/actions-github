# Push a git branch

<!-- These docs are generated by a tool -->

A composite action for pushing a git branch.

This requires `contents: write` permissions in order to work correctly.

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `branch` (*) | The name of the branch to push | _N/A_ |
| `force` | Whether to force-push this branch | `"false"` |
| `target-commitish` | The commit to push as the new branch | `"HEAD"` |

**Note:** _(*) marks required inputs_

## Outputs

`git/push` does not have any outputs at this time

## Example

Here is a very basic example of how to use the `git/push` composite action
in a project (placeholders are used in place of real inputs):

```yaml
run:
  example-job:
    # ... 
    steps:
      # ... 
      - name: Push a git branch
        uses: bitwizeshift/actions-github/git/push@v1
        with:
          # Required inputs
          branch: BRANCH

          # Optional inputs
          force: FORCE
          target-commitish: TARGET_COMMITISH
```
