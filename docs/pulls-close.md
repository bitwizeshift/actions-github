# Close pull request

<!-- These docs are generated by a tool -->

A composite action for closing a pull request.
This requires `pulls: write` permissions in order to work correctly.

| `retries` | The number of times to try retrying | `"0"` |
| `retry-exempt-status-codes` | The retry exempt status codes | `"400,401,403,404,422"` |

## Outputs

|------|-------------|

## Example

Here is a very basic example of how to use the `pulls/close` composite action
in a project (placeholders are used in place of real inputs):

```yaml
run:
  example-job:
    # ... 
    steps:
      # ... 
      - name: Close pull request
        id: pulls-close # only necessary if using this action's output
        uses: bitwizeshift/actions-github/pulls/close@v1
        with:
          # Optional inputs
          owner: OWNER
          pull-number: PULL_NUMBER
          repo: REPO
          retries: RETRIES
          retry-exempt-status-codes: RETRY_EXEMPT_STATUS_CODES
      # ... 
      - name: Uses "Close pull request" Outputs
        uses: example-actions/use-pulls-close@v3 # illustrative
        with:
          use-pull-number: ${{ steps.pulls-close.outputs.pull-number }}
```
