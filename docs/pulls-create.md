# Create pull request

<!-- These docs are generated by a tool -->

A composite action for creating a github pull request.
This requires `pull-requests: write` permissions in order to work correctly.

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Default |

| `head` (*) | The name of the branch where your changes are implemented. For cross-repository pull requests in the same network, namespace head with a user like this: username:branch  | _N/A_ |
| `title` (*) | The title to use for the issue | _N/A_ |
| `assignees` | A list of assignees to add, separated by newlines. | `""` |
| `base` | The name of the branch you want the changes pulled into. This should be an existing branch on the current repository. You cannot submit a pull request to one repository that requests a merge to a base of another repository.  | `""` |
| `body` | The body text of the github issue | `""` |
| `draft` | Indicates whether the pull request is a draft. See "Draft Pull Requests" in the GitHub Help documentation to learn more.  | `"false"` |

| `head-repo` | The name of the repository where the changes in the pull request were made. This field is required for cross-repository pull requests if both repositories are owned by the same organization.  | `""` |
| `issue` | An issue in the repository to convert to a pull request. The issue title, body, and comments will become the title, body, and comments on the new pull request. Required unless `title` is specified.  | `"0"` |

## Example

Here is a very basic example of how to use the `pulls/create` composite action
in a project (placeholders are used in place of real inputs):

```yaml
run:
  example-job:
    # ... 
    steps:
      # ... 
      - name: Create pull request
        id: pulls-create # only necessary if using this action's output(s)
        uses: bitwizeshift/actions-github/pulls/create@v1
        with:
          # Required inputs
          head: HEAD
          title: TITLE

          # Optional inputs
          assignees: ASSIGNEES
          base: BASE
          body: BODY
          draft: DRAFT
          github-token: GITHUB_TOKEN
          head-repo: HEAD_REPO
          issue: ISSUE
          labels: LABELS
          maintainer-can-modify: MAINTAINER_CAN_MODIFY
          owner: OWNER
          repo: REPO
          retries: RETRIES
          retry-exempt-status-codes: RETRY_EXEMPT_STATUS_CODES
      # ... 
      - name: Uses "Create pull request" Outputs
        uses: example-actions/use-pulls-create@v3 # illustrative
