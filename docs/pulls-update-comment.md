# Update comment on Pull Request

<!-- These docs are generated by a tool -->

A composite action for adding labels to github issues.
This requires `issues: write` permissions in order to work correctly.

## Example

Here is a very basic example of how to use the `pulls/update-comment` composite action
in a project (placeholders are used in place of real inputs):

```yaml
run:
  example-job:
    # ... 
    steps:
      # ... 
      - name: Update comment on Pull Request
        id: pulls-update-comment # only necessary if using this action's output(s)
        uses: bitwizeshift/actions-github/pulls/update-comment@v1
        with:
          # Required inputs
          body: BODY
          comment-id: COMMENT_ID

          # Optional inputs
          github-token: GITHUB_TOKEN
          owner: OWNER
          repo: REPO
          retries: RETRIES
          retry-exempt-status-codes: RETRY_EXEMPT_STATUS_CODES
      # ... 
      - name: Uses "Update comment on Pull Request" Outputs
        uses: example-actions/use-pulls-update-comment@v3 # illustrative
        with:
          use-body: ${{ steps.pulls-update-comment.outputs.body }}
          use-comment-id: ${{ steps.pulls-update-comment.outputs.comment-id }}
          use-comment-url: ${{ steps.pulls-update-comment.outputs.comment-url }}
          use-time-since-create: ${{ steps.pulls-update-comment.outputs.time-since-create }}
          use-time-since-last-update: ${{ steps.pulls-update-comment.outputs.time-since-last-update }}
          use-user-login: ${{ steps.pulls-update-comment.outputs.user-login }}
```
