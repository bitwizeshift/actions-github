## Example

Here is a very basic example of how to use the `releases/get` composite action
in a project (placeholders are used in place of real inputs):

```yaml
run:
  example-job:
    # ... 
    steps:
      # ... 
      - name: Get a release
        id: releases-get # only necessary if using this action's output(s)
        uses: bitwizeshift/actions-github/releases/get@v1
        with:
          # Required inputs
          release-id: RELEASE_ID

          # Optional inputs
          github-token: GITHUB_TOKEN
          owner: OWNER
          repo: REPO
          retries: RETRIES
          retry-exempt-status-codes: RETRY_EXEMPT_STATUS_CODES
      # ... 
      - name: Uses "Get a release" Outputs
        uses: example-actions/use-releases-get@v3 # illustrative
        with:
          use-api-url: ${{ steps.releases-get.outputs.api-url }}
          use-body: ${{ steps.releases-get.outputs.body }}
          use-draft: ${{ steps.releases-get.outputs.draft }}
          use-name: ${{ steps.releases-get.outputs.name }}
          use-prerelease: ${{ steps.releases-get.outputs.prerelease }}
          use-release-id: ${{ steps.releases-get.outputs.release-id }}
          use-tag-name: ${{ steps.releases-get.outputs.tag-name }}
          use-target-commitish: ${{ steps.releases-get.outputs.target-commitish }}
          use-url: ${{ steps.releases-get.outputs.url }}
```
