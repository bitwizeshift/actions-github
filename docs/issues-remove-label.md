## Example

Here is a very basic example of how to use the `issues/remove-label` composite action
in a project (placeholders are used in place of real inputs):

```yaml
run:
  example-job:
    # ... 
    steps:
      # ... 
      - name: Remove labels from issue
        uses: bitwizeshift/actions-github/issues/remove-label@v1
        with:
          # Required inputs
          labels: LABELS

          # Optional inputs
          issue-number: ISSUE_NUMBER
          owner: OWNER
          repo: REPO
          retries: RETRIES
          retry-exempt-status-codes: RETRY_EXEMPT_STATUS_CODES
```
