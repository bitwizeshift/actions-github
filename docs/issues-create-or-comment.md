# Create issue or comment

<!-- These docs are generated by a tool -->

A composite action for getting either creating a Github issue, or commenting on
an existing one, based on the author and the provided label(s), assignees, etc.
This requires `issues: write` permissions in order to work correctly.

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `title` (*) | The title to use for the issue | _N/A_ |
| `assignees` | A list of assignees to add, separated by newlines. | `""` |
| `body` | The body text of the github issue | `""` |
| `comment` | The comment to leave if an issue already exists | `"${{ inputs.body }}"` |
| `labels` | A list of labels to add, separated by newlines. | `""` |
| `owner` | The repository owner | `""` |
| `repo` | The repository | `""` |
| `retries` | The number of times to try retrying | `"3"` |
| `retry-exempt-status-codes` | The retry exempt status codes | `"400,401,403,404,422"` |

**Note:** _(*) marks required inputs_

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `created-issue` | A boolean indicating whether a new issue was created |
| `issue-number` | The number of the created issue |
| `issue-url` | The HTTP URL of the newly created issue |

## Example

Here is a very basic example of how to use the `issues/create-or-comment` composite action
in a project (placeholders are used in place of real inputs):

```yaml
run:
  example-job:
    # ... 
    steps:
      # ... 
      - name: Create issue or comment
        id: issues-create-or-comment # only necessary if using this action's output(s)
        uses: bitwizeshift/actions-github/issues/create-or-comment@v1
        with:
          # Required inputs
          title: TITLE

          # Optional inputs
          assignees: ASSIGNEES
          body: BODY
          comment: COMMENT
          labels: LABELS
          owner: OWNER
          repo: REPO
          retries: RETRIES
          retry-exempt-status-codes: RETRY_EXEMPT_STATUS_CODES
      # ... 
      - name: Uses "Create issue or comment" Outputs
        uses: example-actions/use-issues-create-or-comment@v3 # illustrative
        with:
          use-created-issue: ${{ steps.issues-create-or-comment.outputs.created-issue }}
          use-issue-number: ${{ steps.issues-create-or-comment.outputs.issue-number }}
          use-issue-url: ${{ steps.issues-create-or-comment.outputs.issue-url }}
```
