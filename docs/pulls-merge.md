# Merge pull request

<!-- These docs are generated by a tool -->

A composite action for merging a pull request.
This requires `pull-requests: write` permissions in order to work correctly.

## Example

Here is a very basic example of how to use the `pulls/merge` composite action
in a project (placeholders are used in place of real inputs):

```yaml
run:
  example-job:
    # ... 
    steps:
      # ... 
      - name: Merge pull request
        uses: bitwizeshift/actions-github/pulls/merge@v1
        with:
          # Optional inputs
          commit-message: COMMIT_MESSAGE
          commit-title: COMMIT_TITLE
          github-token: GITHUB_TOKEN
          merge_method: MERGE_METHOD
          owner: OWNER
          pull-number: PULL_NUMBER
          repo: REPO
          retries: RETRIES
          retry-exempt-status-codes: RETRY_EXEMPT_STATUS_CODES
          sha: SHA
```
