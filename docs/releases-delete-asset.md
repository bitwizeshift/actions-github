## Example

Here is a very basic example of how to use the `releases/delete-asset` composite action
in a project (placeholders are used in place of real inputs):

```yaml
run:
  example-job:
    # ... 
    steps:
      # ... 
      - name: Delete a release asset
        uses: bitwizeshift/actions-github/releases/delete-asset@v1
        with:
          # Required inputs
          asset-id: ASSET_ID

          # Optional inputs
          github-token: GITHUB_TOKEN
          owner: OWNER
          repo: REPO
          retries: RETRIES
          retry-exempt-status-codes: RETRY_EXEMPT_STATUS_CODES
```
