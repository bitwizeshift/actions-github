    # ... 
    steps:
      # ... 
      - name: Remove assignees from issue
        uses: bitwizeshift/actions-github/issues/remove-assignees@v1
        with:
          # Required inputs
          assignees: ASSIGNEES

          # Optional inputs
          issue-number: ISSUE_NUMBER
          owner: OWNER
          repo: REPO
          retries: RETRIES
