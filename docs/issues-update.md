# Update issue

<!-- These docs are generated by a tool -->

A composite action for updating an existing github issue.
This action will update _all_ fields of the issue, and thus should be used
sparingly. Consider using the `issues/add-*` or `issues/remove-*` series of
steps to alter the issue in-place.
This requires `issues: write` permissions in order to work correctly.

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `title` (*) | The title to use for the issue | _N/A_ |
| `assignees` | A list of assignees to add, separated by newlines. | `""` |
| `body` | The body text of the github issue | `""` |
| `github-token` | The default token to use for this Git operation. If unspecified, this will default to `github.token`.  | `"${{ github.token }}"` |
| `issue-number` | The issue number to comment on. If not specified, this will attempt to retrieve the issue number from the Github `context` variable.  | `"0"` |
| `labels` | A list of labels to add, separated by newlines. | `""` |
| `owner` | The repository owner. If unspecified, this will default to the owner of the current repository.  | `""` |
| `repo` | The name of the repository. If unspecified, this will default to the current repository.  | `""` |
| `retries` | The number of times to attempt to retry if this fails.  | `"0"` |
| `retry-exempt-status-codes` | A list of error-codes that are exempt from being retried.  | `"400,401,403,404,422"` |

**Note:** _(*) marks required inputs_

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `issue-number` | The number of the created issue |
| `issue-url` | The HTTP URL of the newly created issue |

## Example

Here is a very basic example of how to use the `issues/update` composite action
in a project (placeholders are used in place of real inputs):

```yaml
run:
  example-job:
    # ... 
    steps:
      # ... 
      - name: Update issue
        id: issues-update # only necessary if using this action's output(s)
        uses: bitwizeshift/actions-github/issues/update@v1
        with:
          # Required inputs
          title: TITLE

          # Optional inputs
          assignees: ASSIGNEES
          body: BODY
          github-token: GITHUB_TOKEN
          issue-number: ISSUE_NUMBER
          labels: LABELS
          owner: OWNER
          repo: REPO
          retries: RETRIES
          retry-exempt-status-codes: RETRY_EXEMPT_STATUS_CODES
      # ... 
      - name: Uses "Update issue" Outputs
        uses: example-actions/use-issues-update@v3 # illustrative
        with:
          use-issue-number: ${{ steps.issues-update.outputs.issue-number }}
          use-issue-url: ${{ steps.issues-update.outputs.issue-url }}
```
